  - Content text boxes should not have images, instead the images should be opposite to the content
  - The content should be proper paragraghs and should not look like sqaured boxes
  - Do not assume images names for visual images, use images from /steering/Image generation art style/
  - The page colors may be changed. This type of theme might be used ![alt text](image-2.png) where the background is a bit black with grain effect
  - remove errors


- [x] 5. Improve Story Page




  - The UI for choices is too big, make small minimal and creatively artistic
  - Created visuals samples should be taken from this folder .kiro\steering\artStyle\
  - Improve the UI and animations and make them more artistic of this sort ![alt text](image-2.png).
  - For pixel font, use ByteBounce.ttf from public folder.
  - Utilize pacman ghosts' asset from the public folder in a creative and fun way.


- [x] 6. Transform solo game Story Page
  - Currently the solo mode runs on sample data and weird UI, implement the test-story page there
  - The solo play mode should use AI for content generation and the UI should also be same
  - Transform the current solo page with the story game implemented in earlier tasks
  - The AI should give base content of the selected scene, then choices should be generated by AI
  - After user choice, the AI should generate next content based on that
  - For visuals, use images from steering/artStyle
  
  - _Requirements: 6, 9_

- [x] 6.1 Improvements in Story






  - Each time the choices are given, they should be relevant to the current context. The choices should be generated by the AI based on the context and should not be general
  - The choices should not be general
  - The should be given to you as a second person and not third person
  - Everytime I only see choices like this and not proper AI generated choices based on context ![alt text](image-4.png)
  

  - [x] 7. Implement new game in a game-room style





  - Replicate the existing quiz game flow and create an additional game
  - Game flow should be: choose game -> select movie -> select character -> join room
  - Implement a new logic of quiz-game where players have to answer questions about the movie as first come first serve
  - Implement a game where the players have to click the buzzer for answering and then answer the quiz option under 2 sec
  - If a player doesn't answer in given time then the control is taken from them
  - The questions to be asked should be generated and preloaded at the time of game start and not by repeatedly calling the AI
  - Each play would have 20 questions and these questions should be generated at the start. The questions should not be too obvious and general but should be detail oriented and should require deep knowledge about the movie, characters, crew etc
